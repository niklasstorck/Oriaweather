Oriaweather 
______________________
This app is made for SAAF och Margareta Westerlundteleskopet in Oria, Spain.
The background is that the Boltwood file that the telescope farm provided was sometimes too old and that stopped the execution of the plans in ACP/Scheduler. 

The solution is this little app, written in Pascal (Delphi). It reads the roof status file and combine with weather information from openweather.com and writes a Boltwood file as often that we need.

The source code is placed on Github, here: https://github.com/niklasstorck/Oriaweather And is free to use for anyone that so want, preferably with a little note to me.
